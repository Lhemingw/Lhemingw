<h1 align="left">Hey 👋 What's up?</h1>

<h2 align="left">About me</h2>

###

<p align="left">✨ Creating bugs since Oct 2023 took a frontend bootcamp to learn how.  I decided to do this because my resume needed more, and need a job change.<br>📚 I have a Bachelor degree in Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Mgt, I am trying to put those skills into frontend coding for that industry.  I'm currently learning Typescript.<br>🎯 Goals: I am wanting to put  these front end coding skills for the Hotel, Restaurant, and Tourism Mgt industry.<br>🎲 Fun fact: I have been racing since 2014, running since 2011.  I have been winning overalls and age groups since I started to consistently race.  I was a volunteer coach 2017-2020 for USATF club.  Running and racing has taught me to interact with success and project it into real life to where I want to go in life.  Being a teaching sub has taught me more about people, and some of the good habits that teachers have; such as the "get it done now."</p>
